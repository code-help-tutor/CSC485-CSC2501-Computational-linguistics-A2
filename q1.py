    To look up the vector for a word, first you need to look up the word's
    index in the word2vec matrix, which you can then use to get the specific
    vector. More directly, you can look up a string s using word2vec[vocab[s]].

    To look up the vector for a *single word*, use the following rules:
    * If the word exists in the vocabulary, then return the corresponding
      vector.
    * Otherwise, if the lower-cased version of the word exists in the
      vocabulary, return the corresponding vector for the lower-cased version.
    * Otherwise, return a vector of all zeros. You'll need to ensure that
      this vector has the same dimensions as the word2vec vectors.

    But some wordforms are actually multi-word expressions and contain spaces.
    word2vec can handle multi-word expressions, but uses the underscore
    character to separate words rather than spaces. So, to look up a string
    that has a space in it, use the following rules:
    * If the string has a space in it, replace the space characters with
      underscore characters and then follow the above steps on the new string
      (i.e., try the string as-is, then the lower-cased version if that
      fails), but do not return the zero vector if the lookup fails.
    * If the version with underscores doesn't yield anything, split the
      string into multiple words according to the spaces and look each word
      up individually according to the rules in the above paragraph (i.e.,
      as-is, lower-cased, then zero). Take the mean of the vectors for each
      word and return that.
    Recursion will make for more compact code for these.

    Args:
        sentence (list of WSDToken): The sentence containing the word to be
            disambiguated.
        word_index (int): The index of the target word in the sentence.
        vocab (dictionary mapping str to int): The word2vec vocabulary,
            mapping strings to their respective indices in the word2vec array.
        word2vec (np.ndarray): The word2vec word vectors, as a VxD matrix,
            where V is the vocabulary and D is the dimensionality of the word
            vectors.
